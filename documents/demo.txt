Format the key-value pairs as such: {'Week X': {'Title': 'X', 'Topics': ['X', 'X', 'X'], 'Assignments':
['X', 'X', 'X'], 'Assessments': ['X', 'X', 'X']}}, with 'X' characters being replaced with the actual content relevant
to the prompt. If it you believe it would be more appropriate to leave out assignments or assessments on a given week, that is
acceptable, but if you so choose to do that, leave the key-value pair out of the dictionary for that week, like
removing 'Assessments': ['X', 'X', 'X'] from the example.

Create a class for a week, unit, etc.
